Forked from {Rob Olson's}[http://thinkingdigitally.com] excellent first cut at a ruby-native evaluator.

== Description

Ruby-Poker handles the logic for getting the rank of a poker hand. It can also be used to compare two or more hands to determine which hand has the highest poker value.

Card representations can be passed to the PokerHand constructor as a string or an array. Face cards (cards ten, jack, queen, king, and ace) are created using their letter representation (T, J, Q, K, A).

Plural evaluators may be installed and tested for comparative accuracy and efficiency.

== Install

    sudo gem install ruby-poker

== Example

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'ruby-poker'
    
    hand1 = PokerHand.new("8H 9C TC JD QH")
    hand2 = PokerHand.new(["3D", "3C", "3S", "KD", "AH"])
    puts hand1                => 8h 9c Tc Jd Qh (Straight)
    puts hand1.just_cards     => 8h 9c Tc Jd Qh
    puts hand1.rank           => Straight
    puts hand2                => 3d 3c 3s Kd Ah (Three of a kind)
    puts hand2.rank           => Three of a kind
    puts hand1 > hand2        => true

== Duplicates

By default ruby-poker will not raise an exception if you add the same card to a hand twice. You can tell ruby-poker to not allow duplicates by doing the following

    PokerHand.allow_duplicates = false
    
Place that line near the beginning of your program. The change is program wide so once allow_duplicates is set to false, _all_ poker hands will raise an exception if a duplicate card is added to the hand.

== Compatibility

Ruby-Poker is compatible with Ruby 1.8.6 and Ruby 1.9.1.

== History

In the 0.2.0 release Patrick Hurley's Texas Holdem code from http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz24.html was merged into ruby-poker.

TODO Create evaluator object and move current code there
TODO Create performance testing harness
TODO Create evaluator objects for Cactus-Kev 5 and 7-hand evaluators
TODO Create evaluator objects for Two-plus-two-style lookup evaluators
