2008-05-17 (0.3.0)
    * Changed Card#== to compare based on card suit and face value. Before it only compared the face value of two cards. Warning: This change may potentially break your program if you were comparing Card objects directly.
    * Replaced `PokerHand#arranged_hand` with `PokerHand#sort_using_rank` which is more descriptive. This loosely corresponds to bug #20194.
    * Bug [#20196] 'rank' goes into an infinite loop.
    * Bug [#20195] Allows the same card to be entered into the hand.
    * Bug [#20344] sort_using_rank does not return expected results
